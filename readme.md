# Test putting ".gitignore" in a .gitignore file

1. If the .gitignore does not already exist in the repo and ".gitignore" is added to a .gitignore file, the file will be ignored.
2. If the .gitignore file already exists on the repo, adding ".gitignore" does not cause the .gitignore file to be ignored.
